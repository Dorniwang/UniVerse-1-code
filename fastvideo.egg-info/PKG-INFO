## üîß Installation
The code is tested on Python 3.10.0, CUDA 12.1 and H100.
```
./env_setup.sh fastvideo
```

## üöÄ Inference

### Inference FastHunyuan on single RTX4090
We now support NF4 and LLM-INT8 quantized inference using BitsAndBytes for FastHunyuan. With NF4 quantization, inference can be performed on a single RTX 4090 GPU, requiring just 20GB of VRAM.
```bash
# Download the model weight
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/FastHunyuan-diffusers --local_dir=data/FastHunyuan-diffusers --repo_type=model
# CLI inference
bash scripts/inference/inference_hunyuan_hf_quantization.sh
```
For more information about the VRAM requirements for BitsAndBytes quantization, please refer to the table below (timing measured on an H100 GPU):


| Configuration                  | Memory to Init Transformer | Peak Memory After Init Pipeline (Denoise) | Diffusion Time | End-to-End Time |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| BF16 + Pipeline CPU Offload    | 23.883G                   | 33.744G                                    | 81s            | 121.5s          |
| INT8 + Pipeline CPU Offload    | 13.911G                   | 27.979G                                    | 88s            | 116.7s          |
| NF4 + Pipeline CPU Offload     | 9.453G                    | 19.26G                                     | 78s            | 114.5s          |
           


For improved quality in generated videos, we recommend using a GPU with 80GB of memory to run the BF16 model with the original Hunyuan pipeline. To execute the inference, use the following section:

### FastHunyuan
```bash
# Download the model weight
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/FastHunyuan --local_dir=data/FastHunyuan --repo_type=model
# CLI inference
bash scripts/inference/inference_hunyuan.sh
```
You can also inference FastHunyuan in the [official Hunyuan github](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo).

### FastMochi

```bash
# Download the model weight
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/FastMochi-diffusers --local_dir=data/FastMochi-diffusers --repo_type=model
# CLI inference
bash scripts/inference/inference_mochi_sp.sh
```


## üéØ Distill
Our distillation recipe is based on [Phased Consistency Model](https://github.com/G-U-N/Phased-Consistency-Model). We did not find significant improvement using multi-phase distillation, so we keep the one phase setup similar to the original latent consistency model's recipe.
We use the [MixKit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/tree/main/all_mixkit) dataset for distillation. To avoid running the text encoder and VAE during training, we preprocess all data to generate text embeddings and VAE latents.
Preprocessing instructions can be found [data_preprocess.md](docs/data_preprocess.md). For convenience, we also provide preprocessed data that can be downloaded directly using the following command:
```bash
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/HD-Mixkit-Finetune-Hunyuan --local_dir=data/HD-Mixkit-Finetune-Hunyuan --repo_type=dataset
```
Next, download the original model weights with:
```bash
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/hunyuan --local_dir=data/hunyuan --repo_type=model # original hunyuan
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=genmo/mochi-1-preview --local_dir=data/mochi --repo_type=model # original mochi
```
To launch the distillation process, use the following commands:
```
bash scripts/distill/distill_hunyuan.sh # for hunyuan
bash scripts/distill/distill_mochi.sh # for mochi
```
We also provide an optional script for distillation with adversarial loss, located at `fastvideo/distill_adv.py`. Although we tried adversarial loss, we did not observe significant improvements.
## Finetune
### ‚ö° Full Finetune
Ensure your data is prepared and preprocessed in the format specified in [data_preprocess.md](docs/data_preprocess.md). For convenience, we also provide a mochi preprocessed Black Myth Wukong data that can be downloaded directly:
```bash
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/Mochi-Black-Myth --local_dir=data/Mochi-Black-Myth --repo_type=dataset
```
Download the original model weights as specified in [Distill Section](#-distill):

Then you can run the finetune with:
```
bash scripts/finetune/finetune_mochi.sh # for mochi
```
**Note that for finetuning, we did not tune the hyperparameters in the provided script.**
### ‚ö° Lora Finetune 

Hunyuan supports Lora fine-tuning of videos up to 720p. Demos and prompts of Black-Myth-Wukong can be found in [here](https://huggingface.co/FastVideo/Hunyuan-Black-Myth-Wukong-lora-weight). You can download the Lora weight through:
```bash
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/Hunyuan-Black-Myth-Wukong-lora-weight --local_dir=data/Hunyuan-Black-Myth-Wukong-lora-weight --repo_type=model
```
#### Minimum Hardware Requirement
- 40 GB GPU memory each for 2 GPUs with lora.
- 30 GB GPU memory each for 2 GPUs with CPU offload and lora.  


Currently, both Mochi and Hunyuan models support Lora finetuning through diffusers. To generate personalized videos from your own dataset, you'll need to follow three main steps: dataset preparation, finetuning, and inference.

#### Dataset Preparation
We provide scripts to better help you get started to train on your own characters!  
You can run this to organize your dataset to get the videos2caption.json before preprocess. Specify your video folder and corresponding caption folder (caption files should be .txt files and have the same name with its video):
```
python scripts/dataset_preparation/prepare_json_file.py --video_dir data/input_videos/ --prompt_dir data/captions/ --output_path data/output_folder/videos2caption.json --verbose
```
Also, we provide script to resize your videos:
```
python scripts/data_preprocess/resize_videos.py 
```
#### Finetuning
After basic dataset preparation and preprocess, you can start to finetune your model using Lora:
```
bash scripts/finetune/finetune_hunyuan_hf_lora.sh
```
#### Inference
For inference with Lora checkpoint, you can run the following scripts with additional parameter `--lora_checkpoint_dir`:
```
bash scripts/inference/inference_hunyuan_hf.sh 
```
**We also provide scripts for Mochi in the same directory.**

#### Finetune with Both Image and Video
Our codebase support finetuning with both image and video. 
```bash
bash scripts/finetune/finetune_hunyuan.sh
bash scripts/finetune/finetune_mochi_lora_mix.sh
```
For Image-Video Mixture Fine-tuning, make sure to enable the `--group_frame` option in your script.
